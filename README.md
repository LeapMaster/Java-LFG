# Java-LFG

Capstone project for Enterprise Java. A form-based "Looking for Group" website built to allow users to make custom posts looking for teammates in challenging cooperative games. Users can create new listings, filter listings that others have made, register and link an in-game character to speed up the post creation process by automatically filling certain fields. JQuery Validate is used for form validation, reCAPTCHA is used on post creation to eliminate spam, and the Blizzard API is used to pull in character data. The project was built using IntelliJ Idea, and Hibernate is used to interface with the database. The website is built to be easy to modify to fit a variety of games, but uses Blizzard's API with World of Warcraft characters for demonstration purposes.
